# Notes

-   Please have in mind, that I'm no designer
-   I would prefer jest as test setup. due to remaining time will not setup jest

# Left TODOs if this would be a real project with more detailed requirements

-   maybe login and authz / authn
-   layout
-   responsiveness!
-   breadcrumb
-   pagination, search, filter, sorting, category-search in productlist
-   translation
-   create new product / delete product
-   upload new image in edit mode
-   category handling (editable list or fix list)
-   Save Button only active when data changed
-   please note: updated product is not available on productlist since productlist would reload from BE -> real BE
